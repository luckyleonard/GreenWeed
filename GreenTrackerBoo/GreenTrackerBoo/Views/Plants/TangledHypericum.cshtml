            <p class="lead">
                Tangled hypericum is declared under the Catchment and Land Protection Act (1994) as a State prohibited weed. It is native to Europe and the Mediterranean, and believed to have entered Victoria during the gold rush, where it has occurred at Tarnagulla since 1910. Its roots and rhizomes (underground stems) can be spread by cultivation equipment.

                State prohibited weeds either do not occur in Victoria, or are present and can reasonably be expected to be eradicated. State prohibited weeds are the highest category of noxious weeds under the Catchment and Land Protection Act (1994). 
                Tangled hypericum is a very competitive plant with the ability to eliminate most other vegetation. It can be easily spread throughout a paddock and to new locations by contaminated cultivation equipment. Although unconfirmed, it is suspected to be poisonous to stock. It has a very high potential of infesting much of central Victoria.

                Tangled hypericum is an erect perennial herb to 45 cm tall with tangled branches. It reproduces from rhizomes and seed. It could invade open woodlands and agricultural land.
                Arrowhead-shaped leaves (5-15 mm long) are arranged opposite each other along much-branched stems. Stems and leaves both have minute black glands, while only the leaves have translucent oil glands.
                Short-stalked yellow flowers occur in clusters at branch ends in summer. Each flower has five petals. The fruit (3-4 mm long) is a capsule with three compartments.
