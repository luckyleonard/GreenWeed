        <p style=" font-size: large; color: #011f02;">
            Under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994 (CaLP Act) certain plants are declared as noxious weeds in Victoria. These plants cause environmental or economic harm or have the potential to cause such harm. They can also present risks to human health. The CaLP Act defines four categories of noxious weeds:
            <br /><br />
            State Prohibited Weeds<br />
            Regionally Prohibited Weeds<br />
            Regionally Controlled Weeds<br />
            Restricted Weeds.<br /><br />
            Invasive plants are categorised into one of the above four categories for each catchment region in Victoria.
            <br /><br />

        <p style="font-size: large; color: #011f02;">
            Weed Spotters assist the Victorian Government by looking out for and reporting State prohibited weeds.
            <br />
            Weed Spotters are individuals with an interest in plants including contractors, consultants, horticulturalists, local government staff, and other agency staff including Parks Victoria, waterway managers and Catchment Management Authorities.
            <br />
            There are a range of training activities and publications available to Weed Spotters to assist them to identify State prohibited weeds. Training includes weed identification, distinguishing characteristics of the target weeds and how to make a State prohibited weed report. Publications include a training manual, State prohibited weed cards and a subscription to the Weed Spotter newsletter.
            <br />
            The information gathered by Weed Spotters helps to locate new infestations of State prohibited weeds and assist in their management.
